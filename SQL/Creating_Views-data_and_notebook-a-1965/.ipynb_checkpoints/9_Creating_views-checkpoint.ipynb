    "## Views: What is a 'view' and why are they necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, you may have hundreds of tables all linking up with each other. Some or most of the data they contain many not necessarily be informative. This results in complex queries which are needed to extract the informative parts. The underlying complexity also makes it difficult to navigate through all of the database and its multiple relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bearing this dilemma in mind, imagine suddenly that you are on holiday and need to take a photograph of the beautiful landscape you find yourself in. Now unfortunately you can't take a 360-degree photo, which is possibly a good thing as you might want to omit certain aspects that don't make the photo as appealing as you would like. Instead, you would need to frame the photo for the best possible view that captures the landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "We observe that an analogous process can be achieved in SQL. Just as we could frame our view of the landscape, a view in SQL allows a user to view a snapshot of selected data from a table or many tables - presenting only desired information while hiding the underlying complexity/scale of the full dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally speaking, a view is a virtual table that is created within SQL which does not hold any physical storage. Rather, it is stored under \"data dictionary\" memory. A view is similar to a table with regards to how it can be constructed. Furthermore, like tables you can apply many functions to a view such as joins, aggregative operations and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a diagram showing how two tables (employee table & customer table) can be filtered to select certain columns of the data. The view (the table on the right) shows the columns deemed important from the two tables."

    "So if we have the tables, why not just write all the queries and save their results as a new summarised table that can be accessed later?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why this is a bad idea, its important to note that tables in SQL can permanently occupy physical memory and influence the underlying schema of the database. This introduces problems of _complexity_ and _security access_. \n",
    "\n",
    "A view address these problems with its <b>two main functions</b>, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reducing and/or hiding complexity.\n",
    "2. Controlling security access to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A view can _reduce and/or hide complexity_ by combining queries needed to summarise data and make it accessible in a quick manner. Furthermore, by not affecting the underlying schema of the database, there is not need to further normalise the data or create new relationship fields - saving precious time which could be spent elsewhere.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To grasp the second main function of a view, imagine again that you're in a hypothetical scenario where you have admin access to important customer data on a database that is also sensitive. Here, in order to keep this data safe, you might want someone else working on the database to only be able to explore non-confidential aspects of the data, while other tables are restricted. A view allows the administrator to _control security access of the database_ by only allowing a view of certain selected data. "

Views can be made from aggregations, joins and filtering; they can also be used in conjunction with multiple operations and commands. \n",
