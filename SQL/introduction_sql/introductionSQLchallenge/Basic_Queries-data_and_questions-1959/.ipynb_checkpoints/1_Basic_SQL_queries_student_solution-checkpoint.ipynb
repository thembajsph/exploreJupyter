    "You have had a long day and want to sit back and enjoy a movie.  Unfortunately, today you are only in the mood for a very specific type of movie. It definitely needs to be in English. It should also be new, something after 1 Jan 2010, but not too new as you might have seen it recently, so it must have been released before 1 Jan 2016. It should also be a romantic movie, so make sure it has the word love somewhere in the title.  You also want it to be a big blockbuster, so the budget of the move must be more than $10 000 000.\n",
