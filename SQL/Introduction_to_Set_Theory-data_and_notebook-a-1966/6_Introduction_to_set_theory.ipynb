    "## An introduction to set theory \n",
    "\n",
    "Although you can interact with the rows of data from a database table or from multiple tables joined together using JOIN statements, relational databases are really centered around sets. In this train we will be learning about set theory operators namely, `UNION`, `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` in SQL. These fundamental operators have been derived from [set theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyDKR4FG3Yw) and are used to perform various operations on a database. Before we jump into the use of set operators in SQL, let's go ahead and look at the theory behind it all. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a set?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *set* is a collection of *objects*, each of which is an element of the set. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The set of outcomes of a single dice roll is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. 1 is an element of this set, but 7 is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The set of possible traffic light signals is {Red, Amber, Green}. Green is an element of this set, but Purple is not.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "- A subset is a set which is wholly contained in another set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the case of traffic light signal possibilities, i.e., the set: {Red, Amber, Green},  {Red, Green} is a subset of the full set, as are {Amber} and {Amber, Green}.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - However, {Red, Purple} is not a subset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "From a set theory perspective, you can consider a database table as a set and each of its rows as individual elements. This way, queries are a way of selecting a desired **subset** or portion of rows of data in the database. In general, the result set of a query can be considered as a new table that has similar characteristics to a standard database table – this query result is now a set and can be used to write new queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set operators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Union**\n",
    "* $A \\cup B$ – union of sets $A$ and $B$; \n",
    "* Combines Table $A$ and Table $B$ removing all duplicates \n",
    "\n",
    "**Intercept**\n",
    "* $A \\cap B$ – intersection of sets $A$ and $B$; \n",
    "* Returns subset found in Table $A$ and Table $B$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Except**\n",
    "* $A$ – $B$ –  everything in set $A$ except set $B$;\n",
    "* Returns Table $A$ minus any overlap with Table $B$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We are almost there, we just need to go over some rules before we can start using set operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Set operation rules\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the set operation rules that must be followed when using the above listed set operators in a query:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of columns in both tables needs to be equal.\n",
    "2. The columns from each table that we want to combine must contain compatible datatypes.\n",
    "3. We can only apply the ORDER BY clause to the combined (i.e. UNIONised) table and not to the individual tables.\n",
    "4. The GROUP BY clause can only be applied the individual tables (i.e. before the UNION operation) and not the combined result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have all our bases covered, let's explore how each operator works using the Northwind database. "

    "\n",
    "When a UNION operator is employed, it systematically combines two or more sets together removing any duplication of rows by elimination. However, if you want to keep all rows from both tables (i.e. including duplicates) you can use the `ALL` keyword. We will see how this works in a bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a `UNION` operator is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
