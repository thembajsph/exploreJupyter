    "## JOIN Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A JOIN statement is a query that returns records from two tables in the form of a single table. Joins are performed using **keys** as the link. There are four main join statements, namely: the left, right, inner and outer join. In this train, we explore them in detail and provide examples of what the SQL queries for implementing them look like. \n",
    "Previously, to write queries spanning multiple tables we had to connect the designated tables through adding conditions in the `WHERE` clause that aligned data (i.e. records) between tables that shared the same value for a given column. JOIN statements are a much faster and efficient way of connecting tables in the same way. We also don't have to worry about in-between connections over the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Join statements in SQL are closely related to **set operations** where we regard each of the tables to be joined as a set, and then define the JOIN as an a set operation around overlapping data between the two tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a JOIN statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column(s)\n",
    "FROM table1\n",
    "<join_type> JOIN table2\n",
    "ON <Join condition>\n",
