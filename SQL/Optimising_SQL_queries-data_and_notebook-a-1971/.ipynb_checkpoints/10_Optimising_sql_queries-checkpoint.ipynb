We will also use iPython's built-in `%%time` magic command which will measure the execution time of code within a given jupyter cell. To follow along, you will need to download the `flights.db` database file from Athena. The flights database consist of the following tables:\n",

    "\n",
    "Depending on the size of the database and the nature of the query, SQL queries can take a long time to run. Also, writing SQL massive queries can potentially clog a server (in a server-based setup). For example, if a server spends too long on a single query then other queries need to \"wait in line\" for the server to finish processing the one query. As such, it is important that we write more efficient queries. For example, queries that read as much data as is necessary."

    "\n",
    "In this train, we covered different strategies for optimising SQL queries. These can be summarised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Column names instead of ***\n",
    "    - Taxing to return records of all columns for big tables\n",
    "    - Limit amount of data being read by specifying subset of columns\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Create JOINS with INNER, not WHERE**\n",
    "    - WHERE clause does a CROSS join which considers the combination of rows from both tables\n",
    "    - Join statements only iterate through records in the left table when looking for matches.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- **Avoid using the wildcard (%) at the beginning of a predicate**\n",
    "    - Execution will be slower if % at beginning due to full table scan\n",
    "    - Use only trailing wildcard when searching for start of word\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid using functions in predicates**\n",
    "    - Execution will be slower, due to not using indices\n",
    "    - Create CTE to handle it instead\n",
    "     \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Avoid using calculated fields in the JOIN and WHERE clauses**\n",
    "    - Avoid Calculated Fields in JOIN and WHERE clause\n",
    "    - Create CTE to handle it instead\n",
    "    \n",
    "As demonstrated in the train, another quick way to make queries more efficient, particularly in cases where we don't want the full output of a query, is to use the `LIMIT` keyword. "
