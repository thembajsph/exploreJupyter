    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this train, you will learn how to:\n",
    "* Normalize a database up to the $ 3^{rd} $ Normal Form.\n",
    "* Understand data anomalies and how database normalisation reduces the likelihood of their occurrence. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This train is structured as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Anomalies\n",
    "* Imports and DB Connections\n",
    "* Denormalised Table\n",
    "* Convert to $1^{st}$ Normal Form\n",
    "* Convert to $2^{nd}$ Normal Form\n",
    "* Convert to $3^{rd}$ Normal Form\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this train we will give a practical example of database normalisation. Database normalisation is design technique for decoupling table structures to ***reduce*** data redundancies. We will use the tools and techniques that we have learned throughout the course to achieve this result. At each step along the normalisation process, we will reflect on the data anomalies which are being addressed, and how normalisation attempts to remedy their  state. \n"

    "\n",
    "Data anomalies are issues that present themselves in poorly structured or denormalised databases. The following are examples of commonly occuring anomalies which you may find: \n",
    "\n",
    " - **Deletion Anomaly**: The deletion of record that leads to the unintentional removal of another required attribute from the database. \n",
    " - **Insertion Anomaly**: The inability to insert a record as it requires an additional data which may presently not be available.\n",
    " - **Update Anomaly**: This occurs when we have duplicated data; if we were to update the affected rows and a single row gets missed, this will lead to a data inconsistency.\n",

    "We have now completed the normalisation process. From this train you should expect to have a better understanding of some data anomalies which can occur in practice, and how they can be mitigated through database normalisation. However, it is important to note it is sometimes not possible to eliminate all redundancies and data anomalies - we can only minimize them.\n",

    "This design paradigm will assist you in creating relational databases which have minimized data redundancies and avoid data anomalies. Referential Integrity plays a key role in understanding the relationships between tables - which are usually underpinned by business rules. Take time to understand these [business rules](http://etutorials.org/SQL/Database+design+for+mere+mortals/Part+II+The+Design+Process/Chapter+11.+Business+Rules/What+Are+Business+Rules/) when creating your database. This effort will serve you well for organising your data as a future Data Scientist.\n"
