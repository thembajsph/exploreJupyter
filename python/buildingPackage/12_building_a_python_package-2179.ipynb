    "By now, you will have made use of some very popular Python packages such as `numpy` and `pandas`. You will struggle to find a Data Scientist who hasn't, at the very least, *heard* of either of these packages. One of the great features of Python is that it is an open source programing language, with an active community of developers who have helped, and continue to help, make it so user-friendly and versatile. Numpy and Pandas are just two examples of useful packages that you will come across on your data science journey. There are thousands of Python packages out there, and today we are going to learn how to build our own!\n",
