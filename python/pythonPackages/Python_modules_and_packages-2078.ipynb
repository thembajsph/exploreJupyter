    "## Introduction\n",
    "Modular programming is a style of programming that promotes code reusability; allowing us to generate single pieces of code which can be used in multiple parts of a project - thus saving time and resources. The resulting code can be simpler to understand and maintain since components can be considered in isolation. In Python, **modularization** is implemented using functions, modules and packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes, variables and runnable code. These modules can be imported and referenced from other python code. A **python package** (also referred to as a library) is a collection of hierarchically structured directories of python code consisting of sub-packages and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules and packages are two mechanisms that facilitate modular programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why modularization? \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reusability**: Eliminates the need to write new code, as functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplicity**: Modules generally tend to focus on a selected area of the problem which is usually small, rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand. Integrating the use of selected modules will result in you systematically dealing with each small problem in your code making development easier and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maintainability**: Modules in Python are often designed to be self-supporting. In this sense, one module does not depend entirely upon other modules to work. Therefore it is unlikely that modifying a single module of a program will affect other parts of the program. This allows a team of many programmers or data scientists to work collaboratively on a large application."

    "### Creating modules\n",
    "Creating a module is as simply as saving a Python script with functions, classes, variables and running code. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing modules \n",
    "We can access this module and its elements from a different python file by using the `import` statement. \n",
    "* We can import a single module/package:\n",

    "    ```python\n",

    "    ```\n",

    "                      \n",
    "The same rules apply when dealing with packages. We can import specific modules within a package by using dot notation. For this to work, we have to structure packages and modules in a way that reflects the hierarchy in the package directory.\n",

    "In this train, we learned how to create, import and use modules. We also explored the use of built-in modules in Python and how to determine what functions are present within modules. We further looked at Python packages; their creation and hierarchical organization. There are endless uses of modules and packages and each can be tailored to your area of expertise and shared along with other programmers. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply the skills you have gained from this train to create your own custom built modules and packages. You can go ahead and create a package that may assist you with data analysis, or you can even be adventurous and create your very own data-driven game!"
