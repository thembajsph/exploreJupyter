Writing code is not just about writing random words and hoping they will compile, the format and style of those words matter. The same way you would have a hard time reading an essay that is badly punctuated is the same as attempting to read badly formatted code. To achieve high readability in our code we will look at Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) for assistance, specifically PEP-8.\n",

One of the oldest PEP's is PEP-8, which is just simply a set of rules that are used to determine how we should format our code for better readability and neatness. These factors are important in projects where there are people in different departments working on the same piece of code; clean code allows better communication and efficiency in a team. \n",

    "By now we should have a good idea of the basics of writing clean code. We have looked at how to indent, write comments, docstrings, variable names and white space usage. All of this should serve as a starting point for you to write the best code possible with high standards. At EXPLORE Data Science Academy you should aim to go and explore more and learn even more on your own.\n",
